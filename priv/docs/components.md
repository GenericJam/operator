# Components

The `~MOB` sigil (imported automatically by `use Mob.Screen`) is the primary way to write Mob UI. It compiles to plain Elixir maps at compile time — there is no runtime overhead.

## Sigil syntax

```elixir
~MOB"""
<Column padding={16}>
  <Text text="Hello" text_size={:xl} />
  <Button text="Save" on_tap={tap} />
</Column>
"""
```

Expression attributes use `{...}` and support any Elixir expression. For `on_tap` and similar handler props, pre-compute the `{pid, tag}` tuple before the sigil to avoid nested parentheses:

```elixir
def render(assigns) do
  save_tap = {self(), :save}
  ~MOB"""
  <Column padding={16}>
    <Text text={"Count: #{assigns.count}"} text_size={:xl} />
    <Button text="Save" on_tap={save_tap} />
  </Column>
  """
end
```

Expression child slots use `{...}` and accept a single node map or a list:

```elixir
~MOB"""
<Column>
  {Enum.map(assigns.items, fn item ->
    ~MOB(<Text text={item} />)
  end)}
</Column>
"""
```

## Control flow

The sigil borrows three authoring idioms from Phoenix HEEx, so screens read the way LiveView developers expect.

### `@assigns` shorthand

Inside a `{...}` expression, `@foo` rewrites to `assigns.foo` at compile time. It works in attribute values, `{expr}` children, and the `:if`/`:for` directives below. Nested access like `@user.name` works too.

```elixir
def render(assigns) do
  ~MOB"""
  <Column padding={16}>
    <Text text={@title} text_size={:xl} />
    <Text text={"by #{@author.name}"} />
  </Column>
  """
end
```

`@title` is exactly `assigns.title` — the two forms are interchangeable, so reach for whichever reads better.

> **`@foo` only works where `assigns` is in scope** — that is, a screen's or component's `render(assigns)`. Reusable helper functions (the [function composites](#pure-elixir-composite-components) below) take **positional arguments**, and there is no `assigns` inside them, so interpolate the argument directly:
>
> ```elixir
> # Screen render — assigns is in scope:
> def render(assigns), do: ~MOB(<Text text={@title} />)
>
> # Helper — NO @; use the argument:
> def label(title), do: ~MOB(<Text text={title} />)   # not @title
> ```
>
> Reaching for `@foo` inside a helper is the most common mistake here. It raises a `CompileError` naming the fix (`{title}` instead of `@title`) rather than a cryptic "undefined variable assigns". If your `render` parameter is named something other than `assigns` (e.g. `socket`), `@foo` won't find it either — name it `assigns`.

### `:if` — conditional rendering

`:if={expr}` renders the element only when the expression is truthy. A falsy `:if` drops the element entirely (it does not render an empty placeholder):

```elixir
~MOB"""
<Column>
  <Badge text="New" :if={@unread > 0} />
  <Text text="All caught up" :if={@unread == 0} />
</Column>
"""
```

### `:for` — comprehension

`:for={x <- list}` repeats the element once per item and splices the results into the parent's children:

```elixir
~MOB"""
<Column>
  <Row :for={user <- @users}>
    <Text text={user.name} />
  </Row>
</Column>
"""
```

This is the declarative equivalent of the `{Enum.map(...)}` child slot shown above — use whichever is clearer for the case at hand.

### Combining `:for` and `:if`

When both are present on the same element, `:if` acts as a comprehension filter (matching LiveView): an element is produced only for items where the condition holds.

```elixir
# Renders a Text for 2 and 4 only
<Text text={to_string(n)} :for={n <- 1..4} :if={rem(n, 2) == 0} />
```

`:if` and `:for` each require a `{expr}` value — `:if="true"` (a string) raises a `CompileError`. Only `:if` and `:for` are recognised; any other `:`-prefixed attribute is a compile-time error.

## Map syntax

The sigil compiles to plain maps. You can also write them directly — useful when building components programmatically:

```elixir
%{
  type:     :column,
  props:    %{padding: 16},
  children: [
    %{type: :text,   props: %{text: "Hello", text_size: :xl}, children: []},
    %{type: :button, props: %{text: "Save",  on_tap: {self(), :save}}, children: []}
  ]
}
```

The two styles are fully interchangeable — you can mix them freely in the same `render/1` function.

---

`Mob.Renderer` serialises the component tree to JSON and passes it to the native side in a single NIF call. Compose (Android) and SwiftUI (iOS) handle diffing and rendering.

## Prop values

Props accept:

- **Integers and floats** — used as-is (dp on Android, pt on iOS)
- **Strings** — used as-is
- **Booleans** — used as-is
- **Color atoms** (`:primary`, `:blue_500`, etc.) — resolved via the active theme and the base palette to ARGB integers. See [Theming](theming.md).
- **Raw colors** — a 32-bit **`0xAARRGGBB` integer** (alpha first, e.g. `0xFF2196F3`), **not** a CSS `"#RRGGBB"` string and **not** alpha-last. Include the `0xFF` alpha byte or the color renders transparent. See [Theming → Raw colors](theming.md#raw-colors-are-0xaarrggbb-integers-not-css-hex-strings).
- **Spacing tokens** (`:space_xs`, `:space_sm`, `:space_md`, `:space_lg`, `:space_xl`) — scaled by `theme.space_scale` and resolved to integers.
- **Radius tokens** (`:radius_sm`, `:radius_md`, `:radius_lg`, `:radius_pill`) — resolved to integers from the active theme.
- **Text size tokens** (`:xs`, `:sm`, `:base`, `:lg`, `:xl`, `:2xl`, `:3xl`, `:4xl`, `:5xl`, `:6xl`) — scaled by `theme.type_scale` and resolved to floats.

## Platform-specific props

Wrap props in `:ios` or `:android` to apply them only on that platform:

```elixir
props: %{
  padding: 12,
  ios: %{padding: 20}   # iOS sees 20; Android sees 12
}
```

## Layout components

### `:column`

Stacks children vertically.

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `padding` | number / token | Uniform padding |
| `padding_top`, `padding_bottom`, `padding_left`, `padding_right` | number / token | Per-side padding |
| `gap` | number / token | Space between children |
| `background` | color | Background color |
| `width` | positive number | Fixed width in dp/pt. Overrides `fill_width`. |
| `height` | positive number | Fixed height in dp/pt. Overrides `fill_height`. |
| `fill_width` | boolean | Stretch to fill available width (default `true`) |
| `fill_height` | boolean | Stretch to fill available height |
| `align` | `:start` / `:center` / `:end` | Cross-axis alignment of children |

Positive `width` and `height` win over `fill_*` on both platforms. Setting `width`
also pins a `weight`-flexed child on the parent's flex axis, so
`<Column width={90} weight={1}>` inside a Row stays 90 wide.

### `:row`

Lays out children horizontally.

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `padding` | number / token | Uniform padding |
| `gap` | number / token | Space between children |
| `background` | color | Background color |
| `width` | positive number | Fixed width in dp/pt. Overrides `fill_width`. |
| `height` | positive number | Fixed height in dp/pt. |
| `fill_width` | boolean | Stretch to fill available width |
| `align` | `:start` / `:center` / `:end` | Cross-axis alignment of children |

To distribute children evenly across a row, give each child a `weight` prop (analogous to `flex: 1` in CSS):

```elixir
save_tap   = {self(), :save}
cancel_tap = {self(), :cancel}
~MOB"""
<Row fill_width={true}>
  <Button text="Cancel" on_tap={cancel_tap} weight={1} background={:surface} text_color={:on_surface} />
  <Spacer size={8} />
  <Button text="Save" on_tap={save_tap} weight={1} />
</Row>
"""
```

A single weighted child expands into the parent's remaining main-axis space. Multiple
weighted children divide that space evenly on iOS; Android additionally honors unequal
numeric ratios. Weight values must be positive. Use equal weights for cross-platform layouts.

### `:wrap`

Greedily lays out children from start to end and starts a new run when the
next child's measured native width would exceed the available width. This is
the layout to use for chips, tags, filters, and other content-sized items:

```elixir
~MOB"""
<Wrap spacing={:space_sm} run_spacing={:space_sm} fill_width={true}>
  <Box :for={tag <- @tags} fill_width={false} padding={:space_sm} corner_radius={:radius_lg}>
    <Text text={tag} />
  </Box>
</Wrap>
"""
```

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `spacing` | number / token | Horizontal space between children |
| `run_spacing` | number / token | Vertical space between runs |
| `padding` | number / token | Uniform padding |
| `background` | color | Background color |
| `fill_width` | boolean | Stretch the wrap container to the available width |

Children with `fill_width: true` occupy a complete run. `weight` is not
supported inside a wrap; it remains a row/column main-axis concept.

### `:box`

A single-child container. Use it to add background, padding, or corner radius to a child:

```elixir
box_style = {self(), :box}
~MOB"""
<Box background={:surface} padding={:space_md} corner_radius={:radius_md}>
  <Text text="Card content" />
</Box>
"""
```

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `padding` | number / token | Uniform padding |
| `background` | color | Background color |
| `corner_radius` | number / token | Corner radius |
| `fill_width` | boolean | Stretch to fill available width |

### `:scroll`

A vertically scrolling container.

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `padding` | number / token | Padding inside the scroll area |
| `background` | color | Background color |
| `lazy` | boolean | Build only the rows currently on screen. Opt-in; see below |

For a scrolling body with a pinned footer, use
`box(width, fill_height) > column(fill_width, fill_height) > [header, scroll(weight: 1), footer]`.
This gives the weighted scroll bounded height while the footer remains in the
column's non-scrolling space.

#### `lazy: true`

By default a `:scroll` builds every child up front. With `lazy: true`, a scroll
whose direct content is a single `column` builds only what is on screen. On a
500-row screen on a Moto G Power this takes main-thread frame cost from 498.9 ms
to 115.8 ms (p50), and the worst frame from 1385.9 ms to 164.8 ms. Lazy cost is
flat in list length where eager grows, so short lists gain nothing and may be
marginally slower: this is a long-list optimisation.

It is opt-in rather than automatic because laziness has consequences beyond
speed, and all of them are silent:

* **Rows below the fold are never built**, so they never register a frame.
  `Mob.Test.element_frames/1` and `Mob.Test.tap_id/2` cannot address them.
* **`scroll_to(:bottom)` under-scrolls**, because content size reflects only
  what has been built.
* **`screenshot_tour` truncates** for the same reason.
* **Scroll position becomes index-based** rather than pixel-based.

`:lazy_list` already makes that trade explicitly, which is why it is a separate
component. Applying it silently to every `:scroll` would change harness
behaviour under apps that never asked for it.

The narrowing is deliberate: only a **vertical** scroll whose sole child is a
plain `column` qualifies. A `row` under a horizontal scroll would be lazy on the
wrong axis, and a child carrying `weight` needs its siblings measured, so both
stay eager. Anything deeper than the scroll's direct child stays eager too.

Available on both platforms from mob 0.7.39 / mob_new 0.4.31. An app that
upgrades `mob` alone gets it on iOS only.

### `:spacer`

Inserts fixed space in a row or column, or fills available space when no `size` is given.

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `size` | number | Fixed size in dp/pt. Omit to fill remaining space. |

```elixir
# Fixed gap:
~MOB(<Spacer size={16} />)

# Push children to opposite ends of a row:
~MOB"""
<Row>
  <Text text="Left" />
  <Spacer />
  <Text text="Right" />
</Row>
"""
```

## Giving children a stable `:id`

Set `:id` on the children of any container and their view state follows the
child rather than the slot it happens to occupy.

```elixir
for user <- @users do
  %{type: :text_field, props: %{id: user.id, text: user.name}, children: []}
end
```

Without an `:id`, children are identified by position. Insert a row at the top
and every row below it becomes a different view to the platform, so each one
adopts the previous occupant's state: typed text, scroll offset, focus, and any
in-flight animation all shift by one. With an `:id`, they move with the row.

This is the same idea as `:key` in LiveView's `for` comprehensions, and the same
failure mode when it is missing.

### What it affects

Anything the platform owns rather than your socket:

* text a user has typed into a `:text_field` but not submitted
* which field holds focus, and the keyboard's position in it
* scroll offset inside a nested scroll
* toggle and slider positions mid-drag
* animations that are partway through

Values you render from assigns are unaffected either way, because those come
from the tree on every frame.

### Rules

* **An `:id` is opt-in.** A list without one keeps positional identity, so
  nothing changes for code that never asked.
* **Ids only need to be unique among siblings**, not app-wide.
* **A duplicate falls back to position** for the second occurrence rather than
  merging two rows.
* **An authored id and a positional key cannot collide.** They live in separate
  namespaces, so a child whose id is literally `"3"` is distinct from the child
  at position 3.
* **Numbers are coerced**, so `id: user.id` works with integer ids exactly as
  `id: "#{user.id}"` would.

### Limits worth knowing

The coercion is scoped to top-level props. An id nested inside a prop *value* —
`tabs: [%{id: 1}]` — is not coerced and falls back to positional.

Coverage differs by platform for one component. Column, row, box, both scroll
axes, the lazy list and the sheet body key children on both platforms from
mob 0.7.39 / mob_new 0.4.31. **The tab bar is iOS-only**: Compose's
`NavigationBar` still iterates tabs positionally, so reordering or inserting a
tab moves per-tab state on Android and not on iOS.

An app that upgrades `mob` without regenerating from `mob_new` gets the iOS half
only.

## List components

### `:list`

A platform-native scrolling list optimised for rendering many rows efficiently. Prefer this over `:scroll` + `:column` for any list of more than ~20 items.

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `id` | atom | Required list identity; selections arrive as `{:select, id, index}`. |
| `items` | list | Data items. Each renders as a child. |

```elixir
~MOB"""
<List id={:names} items={assigns.names}>
  {Enum.map(assigns.names, fn name ->
    ~MOB(<Text text={name} padding={:space_md} />)
  end)}
</List>
"""
```

### `:lazy_list`

A virtualized list that renders rows on demand. Supports `on_end_reached` for pagination.

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `on_end_reached` | `{pid, tag}` | Fired when the last row appears: `{:tap, tag}` |

`on_end_reached` fires when the final row becomes visible, and is latched on the
row count so that replacing the list's contents does not re-fire it. That
matters because children key on `:id` (see below): replacing the contents gives
every row a new identity, which without the latch reads as a fresh arrival at
the end. A search screen re-queried on each keystroke would otherwise fire one
pagination request per keystroke.

The latch releases when the count changes, which is what makes pagination work:
reach the end, load a page, the list grows, the callback re-arms. Three cases it
does **not** cover, so write the handler to be idempotent:

* a re-query whose result count differs every time still fires once per
  distinct count;
* a **windowed** list holding a rolling buffer at constant length fires once and
  then never again;
* a page load that fails or returns nothing leaves the count unchanged, so
  scrolling away and back will not retry it.

## Content components

### `:text`

Displays a string.

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `text` | string | The text to display (required) |
| `text_size` | number / token | Font size |
| `text_color` | color | Text color |
| `font` | token / string | A named font token from `Mob.Theme`'s `fonts:` map (e.g. `:heading`), or a raw platform font name. See [Styling → Custom fonts](styling.md#custom-fonts). |
| `font_weight` | `"regular"` / `"medium"` / `"bold"` | Font weight |
| `text_align` | `"left"` / `"center"` / `"right"` | Horizontal alignment |
| `max_lines` | integer, 1–2,147,483,647 | Maximum lines to render; overflow is truncated with an ellipsis. Omit to wrap without limit. |

A one-line name beside an amount that must not shrink:

```elixir
~MOB"""
<Row fill_width={true}>
  <Text text={@merchant} max_lines={1} weight={1} />
  <Text text={@amount} />
</Row>
"""
```

### `:button`

A tappable button. Has sensible defaults injected by the renderer (primary background, on_primary text, medium radius, fill width).

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `text` | string | Button label |
| `on_tap` | `{pid, tag}` | Tap handler. Delivers `{:tap, tag}` to `handle_info/2`. |
| `background` | color | Background color (default `:primary`) |
| `text_color` | color | Label color (default `:on_primary`) |
| `text_size` | number / token | Font size (default `:base`) |
| `font_weight` | string | Font weight (default `"medium"`) |
| `padding` | number / token | Padding (default `:space_md`) |

| `fill_width` | boolean | Fill available width (default `true`) |
| `weight` | float | Flex weight inside a `:row` or `:column` |
| `disabled` | boolean | Disable tap interaction |

```elixir
save_tap   = {self(), :save}
cancel_tap = {self(), :cancel}
~MOB(<Button text="Save" on_tap={save_tap} />)
~MOB(<Button text="Cancel" on_tap={cancel_tap} background={:surface} text_color={:on_surface} />)
```

### `:text_field`

An editable text input. Has defaults injected by the renderer (surface_raised background, border, small radius).

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `value` | string | Current text (controlled) |
| `placeholder` | string | Hint text when empty |
| `on_change` | `{pid, tag}` | Fires as the user types. Delivers `{:change, tag, value}` to `handle_info/2`. |
| `on_submit` | `{pid, tag}` | Fires on keyboard return. Delivers `{:submit, tag}`. |
| `on_focus` | `{pid, tag}` | Fires when the field gains focus. Delivers `{:focus, tag}`. |
| `on_blur` | `{pid, tag}` | Fires when the field loses focus. Delivers `{:blur, tag}`. |
| `secure` | boolean | Password masking |
| `keyboard_type` | `:default` / `:email` / `:number` / `:phone` | Keyboard variant |
| `background` | color | Background (default `:surface_raised`) |
| `text_color` | color | Input text color (default `:on_surface`) |

| `padding` | number / token | Padding (default `:space_sm`) |
| `corner_radius` | number / token | Corner radius (default `:radius_sm`) |
| `border_width` | number | Border width |
| `caret_color` | color | Caret colour (default: follows `text_color`, so transparent text hides the caret) |
| `text_size`, `font_weight`, `italic`, `font`, `letter_spacing` | as `:text` | Type of the typed text and the placeholder |
| `text_align` | `:left` / `:center` / `:right` | Alignment of the text and the placeholder |
| `disabled` / `enabled` | boolean | `disabled: true` or `enabled: false` makes the field read-only and dims its text to 38% |
| `max_length` | integer | Rejects edits that would lengthen the text past this many UTF-16 units; a longer value set by the screen can still be shortened |
| `lines` | integer | Above 1: a multi-line field this many rows tall; return inserts a newline and `on_submit` does not fire |
| `caret` | `"end"` | Pins the insertion point to the end of the text wherever the field is tapped (segmented code inputs). On iOS a pinned field (as one with `on_compose`) is single-line: `lines` is ignored with it |
| `underline` | boolean | Android only: Material's indicator line (default: on unless the field draws its own border) |

### `:divider`

A horizontal rule. Default color is `:border`.

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `color` | color | Line color (default `:border`) |

### `:progress`

An indeterminate activity indicator (spinner).

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `color` | color | Indicator color (default `:primary`) |

### `:toggle`

A boolean switch. Delivers `{:change, tag, value}` to `handle_info/2` where `value` is `true` or `false`.

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `value` | boolean | Current checked state |
| `label` | string | Label text displayed beside the toggle |
| `on_change` | `{pid, tag}` | Fires when toggled. Delivers `{:change, tag, bool}`. |
| `color` | color | Thumb/track tint color |

```elixir
toggle_change = {self(), :notifications_toggled}
~MOB(<Toggle value={assigns.notifications_on} label="Enable notifications" on_change={toggle_change} />)

def handle_info({:change, :notifications_toggled, enabled}, socket) do
  {:noreply, Mob.Socket.assign(socket, :notifications_on, enabled)}
end
```

### `:slider`

A continuous value input. Delivers `{:change, tag, value}` to `handle_info/2` where `value` is a float.

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `value` | float | Current value |
| `min` | float | Minimum value (default `0.0`) |
| `max` | float | Maximum value (default `1.0`) |
| `on_change` | `{pid, tag}` | Fires as the user drags. Delivers `{:change, tag, float}`. |
| `color` | color | Track and thumb color |

```elixir
volume_change = {self(), :volume_changed}
~MOB(<Slider value={assigns.volume} min={0.0} max={1.0} on_change={volume_change} />)

def handle_info({:change, :volume_changed, value}, socket) do
  {:noreply, Mob.Socket.assign(socket, :volume, value)}
end
```

### `:canvas`

A declarative 2D drawing surface (SwiftUI `Canvas` on iOS, Compose `Canvas` on Android). Build the op list with `Mob.Canvas` helpers. Coordinates are canvas-local in pt/dp, top-left origin.

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `width` | number | Canvas width in pt/dp |
| `height` | number | Canvas height in pt/dp |
| `draw` | list | Draw ops (`Mob.Canvas.line/5`, `circle/4`, …) |
| `on_tap` | `{pid, tag}` | A tap anywhere on the canvas delivers `{:tap, tag}`. |
| `on_drag` | `{pid, tag}` / `{pid, tag, throttle_opts}` | Finger drag. Delivers `{:drag, tag, payload}` with canvas-local `x`/`y` (see the [Events guide](events.md)). On iOS a stationary tap also fires a zero-length drag; on Android a drag starts only past touch slop. |

```elixir
import Mob.Canvas

board_tap = {self(), :board}
ops = [circle(60, 60, 50, color: :primary, width: 4)]
~MOB(<Canvas width={120} height={120} draw={ops} on_tap={board_tap} />)

def handle_info({:tap, :board}, socket), do: {:noreply, socket}
```

## Overlay components

### `:sheet`

A native modal bottom sheet (iOS `.sheet`, Android Material 3
`ModalBottomSheet`) that composes ordinary Mob nodes as its content. Build one
with `Mob.UI.sheet/2` or the `<Sheet>` tag.

There is no `presented` boolean: **presence in the render tree is
presentation**. Rendering the sheet node presents it, a re-render that still
includes it updates its content in place, and removing it from the tree
dismisses it. So sheet visibility is an ordinary assign plus `:if`:

```elixir
def render(assigns) do
  dismiss = {self(), :sheet_dismissed}
  ~MOB"""
  <Column padding={:space_md}>
    <Text text="Main content" />
    <Sheet detents={[:medium, :large]} on_dismiss={dismiss} :if={@show_sheet}>
      <Text text="Hello from the sheet" padding={:space_md} />
    </Sheet>
  </Column>
  """
end

def handle_info({:dismiss, :sheet_dismissed}, socket) do
  # The user swiped the sheet down — mirror that in your state, or the next
  # render will present it again.
  {:noreply, Mob.Socket.assign(socket, :show_sheet, false)}
end
```

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `detents` | list | Stops the sheet can rest at: a subset of `[:medium, :large]`, or the exclusive content-height detent `[:content]` / `[{:content, max_height: n}]`. Default `[:medium, :large]`. Invalid detents raise, both in `Mob.UI.sheet/2` and again at render time. |
| `on_dismiss` | `{pid, tag}` | Delivered as `{:dismiss, tag}` to `handle_info/2`, exactly once, when the user dismisses the sheet (swipe-down, back gesture, outside tap) |
| `background` | color | Sheet container color |
| `scrim` | color | Dimming-layer color. Applied exactly on Android; **iOS cannot set the system dimming opacity** and stays system-black |
| `corner_radius` | number / token | Top-corner radius |
| `drag_indicator_color` / `_width` / `_height` / `_rail_height` | color / numbers | Custom drag-indicator capsule. All four together, or omit all four for the platform default |
| `ios` / `android` | map | Per-platform overrides of the style props above |

A `:content` detent sizes the sheet from its content's *intrinsic* height —
it hugs short content and caps at `max_height` (and at live screen geometry).
Because a scrollable child (`scroll`, `lazy_list`) reports its full content
height, it expands inside the sheet rather than scrolling independently; use
`:medium`/`:large` when the sheet's body is itself scrollable. On iOS a
content sheet presents at `:medium` for its first frame and resizes once the
content has been measured.

See `Mob.UI.sheet/2` for the full option reference and validation rules.

### `:anchored`

A floating panel positioned relative to an in-flow anchor: the first child is
the **anchor** (a popover's trigger) and renders in place; the second child is
the **panel** and renders over the page, above every Box and Scroll between it
and the screen root, so nothing on the way up can clip it. Omit the panel to
render the anchor alone (a closed popover). The screen owns open and closed:
the panel never dismisses itself.

```elixir
close = {self(), :close_menu}

~MOB"""
<Anchored side="bottom" align="start" side_offset={4} on_tap={close}>
  <Button text="Options" on_tap={{self(), :open_menu}} />
  <Box :if={@menu_open} background={:surface} corner_radius={:radius_md} padding={:space_sm}>
    <Text text="Rename" />
  </Box>
</Anchored>
"""
```

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `side` | `"top"` / `"right"` / `"bottom"` / `"left"` | Which side of the anchor the panel sits on (default `"bottom"`) |
| `align` | `"start"` / `"center"` / `"end"` | Alignment along the other axis (default `"center"`) |
| `side_offset` | number | Gap between anchor and panel |
| `align_offset` | number | Nudge along the align axis; positive pushes inward on `"end"` |
| `panel_offset_x`, `panel_offset_y` | number | Raw nudge applied last (the node's own `offset_x`/`offset_y` would move the anchor) |
| `flip` | boolean | Swap to the opposite side when the requested one has no room and the other does (default `true`) |
| `clamp` | boolean | Keep the panel inside the window while the anchor is on screen (default `true`) |
| `edge_padding` | number | Distance kept from the window edges, added to the safe area (default `8`) |
| `panel_max_width`, `panel_max_height` | number | Caps on the panel (default: window minus twice `edge_padding`) |
| `on_tap` | `{pid, tag}` | A tap **outside** the panel delivers `{:tap, tag}` — the dismiss request. Without it an outside tap does nothing. |

Placement is the same arithmetic on both platforms (the web `positionPopup()`
transliterated): a main-axis flip only when both conditions hold, then a clamp
on both axes. Android renders the panel in its own window; iOS collects the
anchor's bounds with an anchor preference and draws the panel at the root.
The Mishka Chelekom popover, tooltip, menu, select and combobox ports build on
it.

## Native view components

### `:webview`

Embeds a native web view. Communicates bidirectionally with JS via the `window.mob` bridge. See [WebView](device_capabilities.md#webview) for the full message-passing API.

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `url` | string | Initial URL to load (required) |
| `allow` | list of strings | URL prefixes that are allowed to navigate; others are blocked and delivered as `{:webview, :blocked, url}` |
| `show_url` | boolean | Show the native URL bar |
| `title` | string | Static title label, overrides `show_url` |
| `width` | number | Fixed width in dp/pt |
| `height` | number | Fixed height in dp/pt |
| `weight` | float | Flex weight inside a `:row` or `:column` |

```elixir
~MOB"""
<WebView url="https://example.com"
         allow={["https://example.com"]}
         show_url={true}
         weight={1} />
"""
```

### `:camera_preview`

Displays a live camera feed inline. The `<CameraPreview>` node itself ships in core, but the preview session is driven by `MobCamera` (the `mob_camera` plugin — add the dep + activate in `mob.exs`; see the [Plugins guide](plugins.md)). Call `MobCamera.start_preview/2` before rendering and `MobCamera.stop_preview/1` in `terminate/2`. No OS permission dialog is shown for preview alone.

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `facing` | `:back` / `:front` | Camera to use |
| `weight` | float | Flex weight inside a `:row` or `:column` |
| `width` | number | Fixed width in dp/pt |
| `height` | number | Fixed height in dp/pt |

```elixir
def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
  socket = MobCamera.start_preview(socket, facing: :back)
  {:ok, socket}
end

def render(assigns) do
  flip_tap = {self(), :flip}
  ~MOB"""
  <Column>
    <CameraPreview facing={:back} weight={1} />
    <Button text="Flip" on_tap={flip_tap} />
  </Column>
  """
end

def terminate(_reason, socket) do
  MobCamera.stop_preview(socket)
  :ok
end
```

## Defining your own components

You can build reusable components out of the built-in widgets with no native
code, in two forms: **function composites** (a plain function you call) and
**tag composites** (a custom `<Tag>` you register). Both are stateless, pure
Elixir, and hot-pushable. Events raised from inside either kind route to the
**screen's** `handle_info/2`, exactly like a built-in widget does.

> **Reached for `use Mob.Component`?** Easy mix-up: it's a *different* feature.
> `Mob.Component` is the behaviour for **native view components**, a stateful BEAM
> process paired with a platform-native view (declared via `Mob.UI.native_view/2`),
> whose `render/1` returns a **props map for a native factory** rather than a `~MOB`
> tree. That's an advanced, native-code path (see the [Plugins guide](plugins.md)). If
> you just want a reusable widget or custom `<Tag>` built out of the **built-in**
> components, with no native code, that's the `Mob.Composite` path below. The names are
> close; for pure-Elixir tags the one you want is **Composite**, and its module returns
> a `~MOB` tree from `expand/3`.

### Function composites

A function composite is a function that returns a render tree. You call it
through `{...}` interpolation inside the sigil. This is the lightest way to
factor out a chunk of UI you repeat.

Here is a complete screen that defines a `stat_card/3` composite and uses it.
The tap target is built in `render/1` and passed in as an argument, so the
button inside the composite delivers to this screen's `handle_info/2`:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.DashboardScreen do
  use Mob.Screen

  @impl true
  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
    {:ok, Mob.Socket.assign(socket, :taps, 0)}
  end

  # A function composite: returns a render tree, so it drops into the screen
  # via {...}. `on_tap` is a pre-built {pid, tag} tuple passed in by the caller.
  defp stat_card(label, value, on_tap) do
    ~MOB"""
    <Box background={:surface_raised} corner_radius={:radius_md} padding={:space_md}>
      <Column gap={4}>
        <Text text={label} text_size={:sm} text_color={:muted} />
        <Text text={to_string(value)} text_size={:2xl} text_color={:on_surface} />
        <Button text="Tap me" on_tap={on_tap} />
      </Column>
    </Box>
    """
  end

  @impl true
  def render(assigns) do
    bump = {self(), :bump}

    ~MOB"""
    <Column padding={:space_lg} gap={12}>
      <Text text="Dashboard" text_size={:xl} text_color={:on_surface} />
      {stat_card("Taps", @taps, bump)}
    </Column>
    """
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_info({:tap, :bump}, socket) do
    {:noreply, Mob.Socket.update(socket, :taps, &(&1 + 1))}
  end
end
```

Two things to notice:

- `@taps` inside `{stat_card(...)}` is `assigns.taps` (the `@` shorthand works
  in any `{...}` expression, including a composite call).
- The composite is a plain function call in `render/1`, which runs in the screen
  process, so events from the `<Button>` inside it reach this screen. Building
  the `{self(), :bump}` tuple in `render/1` and passing it in keeps the
  composite reusable and follows the pre-compute-the-tuple convention.

### Tag composites

A tag composite gives you custom tag syntax, like `<Card title="...">`. You
register an *expander* for the tag, then write the tag in any screen.

The sigil turns a PascalCase tag into a snake_case atom (`<Card>` becomes
`:card`, `<LabeledButton>` becomes `:labeled_button`), and the expander is
looked up by that atom. An expander is a function `expand(props, children, ctx)`
that returns a render tree (`~MOB` output).

**Step 1 — write the expanders.** `Card` wraps its children in a titled
surface; `LabeledButton` raises a tap event:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.UI.Card do
  @moduledoc "`<Card title=\"...\">children</Card>` — a titled raised surface."
  import Mob.Sigil

  @spec expand(map(), [map()], map()) :: map()
  def expand(props, children, _ctx) do
    title = Map.get(props, :title, "")

    ~MOB"""
    <Column background={:surface_raised} corner_radius={:radius_md} padding={:space_md}>
      <Text text={title} text_size={:lg} text_color={:on_surface} />
      <Spacer size={8} />
      {children}
    </Column>
    """
  end
end

defmodule MyApp.UI.LabeledButton do
  @moduledoc ~S(`<LabeledButton label="..." on_press="save" />` — a button with an auto-injected tap target.)
  import Mob.Sigil

  @spec expand(map(), [map()], map()) :: map()
  def expand(props, _children, _ctx) do
    label = Map.get(props, :label, "")
    # `on_press` arrives already shaped as {screen_pid, :save} (see "Event
    # ergonomics" below), so we pass it straight to the button's on_tap.
    on_press = Map.fetch!(props, :on_press)

    ~MOB"""
    <Button text={label} on_tap={on_press} />
    """
  end
end
```

`~MOB` is auto-imported inside `use Mob.Screen`, but an expander is a plain
module, so it needs `import Mob.Sigil`.

**Step 2 — register the tags.** Through a plugin manifest's `ui_components`:

```elixir
ui_components: [
  %{tag: "Card",          atom: :card,           expand: {MyApp.UI.Card, :expand}},
  %{tag: "LabeledButton", atom: :labeled_button, expand: {MyApp.UI.LabeledButton, :expand}}
]
```

…or at runtime, for a plain Hex UI kit with no manifest (call from the host's
`on_start/0`) via `Mob.Composite.register/2`:

```elixir
Mob.Composite.register(:card, {MyApp.UI.Card, :expand})
Mob.Composite.register(:labeled_button, {MyApp.UI.LabeledButton, :expand})
```

**Declare the tag in config so the sigil accepts it at compile time.**
Registration happens at *runtime* (from `on_start/0` or a plugin manifest), so
the `~MOB` macro can't see it while compiling a screen. Without a declaration
every custom tag prints a warning the first time it's compiled:

```
~MOB: <Card> is not in the Mob tag whitelist — pass-through as :card
```

That is informational, not an error — the sigil compiles `<Card>` to the atom
`:card` and defers resolution to whatever expander is registered under that atom
at render time — but under `--warnings-as-errors` it is a wall. List the tags
your app registers and the warning goes away:

```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :mob, :extra_tags, ~w(Card LabeledButton)   # PascalCase strings, [:card, ...], or [Card, ...]
```

This whitelists the tag for the sigil only. `Mob.ScreenCase.assert_renderable/2`
checks the *expanded* tree against the native whitelist, so expand composites
first (`Mob.Composite.expand/2`) or pass the type via `extra:`.

The list is read at each screen's compile time from the app's own config, so
nothing in `deps/mob` is edited. Mix does not track that read: after editing
the list, `mix compile --force` (or touching the screens) recompiles modules
that were already built. (A tag that is declared but never registered
renders nothing, which is the real "it doesn't work" symptom to look for.)

**Step 3 — use them in a screen.** Note there is no `self()` anywhere in this
markup:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ProfileScreen do
  use Mob.Screen

  @impl true
  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
    {:ok, Mob.Socket.assign(socket, :status, "not saved yet")}
  end

  @impl true
  def render(assigns) do
    ~MOB"""
    <Column padding={:space_lg} gap={12}>
      <Card title="Profile">
        <Text text="Tap save to record it." text_color={:muted} />
        <Spacer size={8} />
        <LabeledButton label="Save" on_press="save" />
      </Card>
      <Card title="Status">
        <Text text={@status} text_color={:primary} />
      </Card>
    </Column>
    """
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_info({:tap, :save}, socket) do
    {:noreply, Mob.Socket.assign(socket, :status, "saved")}
  end
end
```

**The expander contract.** `expand(props, children, ctx)` returns a node map or
a list of nodes, which is re-expanded to a fixpoint so composites can build on
other composites. `ctx` carries the screen process as `ctx.screen`.

**Event ergonomics (auto-injected targets).** Any `on_*` prop you write on a
composite tag as a bare string or atom (`on_press="save"`) arrives in the
expander's `props` already shaped as `{screen_pid, :save}`. That is why
`ProfileScreen` never writes `self()`, and why the screen receives
`{:tap, :save}` in `handle_info/2`.

This auto-injection applies only to a composite tag's **own** props. A built-in
widget you place directly (a `<TextField>` or `<Button>` in a screen's own
markup, even one nested inside a composite's children) still needs an explicit
`{self(), tag}` tuple, because its props are not run through an expander. That
is why `DashboardScreen` above builds `bump = {self(), :bump}` for its plain
`<Button>`, while `ProfileScreen` can write `<LabeledButton on_press="save">`
unadorned: `LabeledButton` is a composite tag, so its `on_press` is shaped for
you.

For the full design see `Mob.Composite` and the "Pure-Elixir composite
components" section of [`MOB_PLUGINS.md`](../MOB_PLUGINS.md). The `mob_demo_kit`
plugin in `mob_plugin_demo` (`<DemoCard>` / `<DemoCombobox>`) is a worked,
device-verified example.

## Using `Mob.Style` for reusable styles

Define shared styles as module attributes and attach them via the `:style` prop. Inline props override style values:

```elixir
@card_style %Mob.Style{props: %{background: :surface, padding: :space_md, corner_radius: :radius_md}}
@title_style %Mob.Style{props: %{text_size: :xl, font_weight: "bold", text_color: :on_surface}}

def render(assigns) do
  %{type: :box, props: %{style: @card_style}, children: [
    %{type: :text, props: %{style: @title_style, text: assigns.title}, children: []},
    %{type: :text, props: %{text: assigns.body,  text_color: :muted,  text_size: :sm}, children: []}
  ]}
end
```

## Tap handler conventions

Use tagged tuples for tap handlers so you can pattern-match on the tag in `handle_info/2`. Pre-compute the tuple before the sigil to avoid nesting parentheses inside `{...}`:

```elixir
def render(assigns) do
  save_tap = {self(), :save}
  ~MOB"""
  <Button text="Save" on_tap={save_tap} />
  """
end

def handle_info({:tap, :save}, socket) do
  ...
end
```

## Event routing

**All events are delivered to the screen process via `handle_info/2`.** `self()` inside `render/1` is always the screen's GenServer pid. Event handler props such as `on_tap` and `on_change` send directly to that process, regardless of how deeply the component is nested in the tree. `Mob.List` selections are routed separately through the list's `id`.

| Handler or component | Message delivered to `handle_info/2` |
|---|---|
| `on_tap: {pid, tag}` | `{:tap, tag}` |
| `on_change: {pid, tag}` | `{:change, tag, value}` |
| `Mob.List` with `id: id` | `{:select, id, index}` |
| `on_submit: {pid, tag}` | `{:submit, tag}` |
| `on_focus: {pid, tag}` | `{:focus, tag}` |
| `on_blur: {pid, tag}` | `{:blur, tag}` |
| `on_long_press: {pid, tag}` | `{:long_press, tag}` |
| `on_press_in: {pid, tag}` | `{:press_in, tag}` |
| `on_press_out: {pid, tag}` | `{:press_out, tag}` |

### Press and release: `on_press_in` / `on_press_out`

`on_press_in` fires when a finger goes down on the node; `on_press_out` when
that finger lifts **or** its touch is cancelled (the system took the gesture,
the node left the screen). Sliding off the node, or an ancestor scrolling
under the finger, does not end the press: it lasts until the finger lifts.
On a node that declares both, every `{:press_in, tag}` is followed by exactly
one `{:press_out, tag}`, even when the screen re-renders in between, which a
press usually causes. They work on every node type, `:button` included, and
they observe without consuming: `on_tap`, `on_long_press` and an ancestor's
scrolling keep working on the same node. A quick tap delivers
`{:press_in, tag}`, `{:press_out, tag}`, then `{:tap, tag}`.

On iOS 17 the observer is a SwiftUI `DragGesture` fallback (iOS 18 added the
UIKit bridge the 18+ path uses), not yet run on an iOS 17 device: there it may
stop an enclosing ScrollView from scrolling when the drag starts on the node,
and inside a ScrollView a quick tap's `{:tap, tag}` may arrive before its
`{:press_in, tag}`. Don't rely on the order of `tap` and `press_in` there.

That is what hold-to-talk, push-to-record, "peek" previews and press-and-hold
buttons need:

```elixir
def render(assigns) do
  ~MOB"""
  <Box id="mic" padding={16} background={:primary}
       on_press_in={{self(), :mic}} on_press_out={{self(), :mic}}>
    <Text text={if @listening, do: "● listening", else: "hold to talk"} />
  </Box>
  """
end

def handle_info({:press_in, :mic}, socket),
  do: {:noreply, Mob.Socket.assign(socket, listening: true, pressed_at: System.monotonic_time(:millisecond))}

def handle_info({:press_out, :mic}, socket) do
  held = System.monotonic_time(:millisecond) - socket.assigns.pressed_at
  # A press too short to say anything: cancel instead of transcribing.
  {:noreply, Mob.Socket.assign(socket, listening: false, too_short: held < 300)}
end
```

Measure the hold on the BEAM as above: both events cross the same channel,
so the latency cancels out. Test it without a finger: `Mob.Test.hold/3`
sends the pair by tag on any platform, and on Android `Mob.Test.hold_xy/4`
(or `press_down_xy/4` … `press_up_xy/3`) holds a real touch through the
native detector. Android needs a bridge generated by `mob_new` 0.6.5 or newer.

### Handle limits

The native layer stores event handlers per committed frame:

- **4096 interactive handles per frame.** Every `on_tap`, `on_change`,
  `on_focus`, etc. in the rendered tree registers one handle. The tables grow
  on demand — they start small and are allocated to fit — so an app that uses
  a few dozen handles pays for a few dozen. Past 4096 the element still renders
  but its handler is silently unwired, and the count of unwired elements is
  logged once per frame; it does not crash the screen.

  This was 256 until MOB-133, which is low enough that an ordinary long list
  reached it: a 200-row list with three interactive elements per row left more
  than half of them inert. If you are anywhere near the current limit, prefer
  `:list` / `:lazy_list`, or `lazy: true` on a `:scroll`, so only what is on
  screen registers at all.
- **256 native component slots.** `Mob.UI.native_view/2` / `Mob.Component`
  instances each take a slot. A full pool returns
  `{:error, :component_slots_exhausted}`; the framework logs and fails just
  that one component, leaving the screen alive.

### Sub-component event isolation (planned, not yet implemented)

Per-subtree event isolation, where a render subtree owns its own `handle_info/2` so its events route to a dedicated process instead of the screen, is planned but not yet implemented. (Distinct from `Mob.Composite`, the tag-composite mechanism under "Defining your own components" above, which exists today for reusable widgets and custom tags; and from `Mob.Component`, the existing native-view behaviour.) Until then, use the `tag` field to distinguish events from different parts of the same screen:

```elixir
top_save_tap    = {self(), :top_save}
bottom_save_tap = {self(), :bottom_save}
~MOB"""
<Button text="Top Save"    on_tap={top_save_tap} />
<Button text="Bottom Save" on_tap={bottom_save_tap} />
"""
```

---

## Code formatting

`mix format` understands `~MOB` sigils through `Mob.Formatter`, a first-class
formatter plugin. Generated projects include a `.formatter.exs` that enables it
automatically:

```elixir
# .formatter.exs
[
  plugins: [Mob.Formatter],
  inputs: ["{mix,.formatter}.exs", "{config,lib,test}/**/*.{ex,exs}"]
]
```

Running `mix format` then normalises indentation, wraps long attribute lists, and
aligns expression children — in a single pass alongside all other Elixir code.

See [Tooling & Formatting](tooling.md) for the full guide and `Mob.Formatter` for
the API reference.
