# mob.exs — Mob project configuration: plugin activation, plugin trust,
# styles, and build settings. Commit it — a clone without it activates no
# plugins, so their NIFs are left out of the native build.
#
# Machine-specific overrides (e.g. a local `mob_dir` checkout) go in
# mob.local.exs, which is gitignored and imported at the end of this file.
#
# OTP runtimes for Android and iOS are downloaded automatically by `mix mob.install`.

# Activated capability plugins (the packages added in mix.exs). Each contributes
# its native code, permissions, and any demo screens at build time. Drop a name
# here to deactivate a plugin without removing the dep; remove both to drop it
# entirely (the native build shrinks and a clean rebuild prunes its artifacts).

# Trust gate for the first-party plugins. Each is signed in CI with the shared
# mob release key; this is that key's public fingerprint. The build refuses an
# ACTIVATED plugin whose signature doesn't verify against a trusted fingerprint
# (tamper protection) — entries for plugins you haven't activated are simply
# unused, so every official plugin is pre-trusted and "just works" the moment
# you add it to deps + :plugins above. For your own/third-party plugins, run
# `mix mob.plugin.trust <name>`, or `config :mob, :acknowledge_unsafe_plugins,
# [...]` for an unsigned prototype.
